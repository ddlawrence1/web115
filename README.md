## Reflection

For this project, I wanted to build a simple but fun Task Manager that felt easy to use and visually nice to look at.  
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create it. My main goal was to make the design colorful but not overwhelming, so I added an animated gradient background and used warm, cozy colors like browns and tans.  
I also experimented with a custom font to give it a unique look.

One of the challenges I ran into was getting the gradient animation to look smooth without being too distracting. It took a few tries to get the timing and colors right.  
Another thing that took some time was figuring out how to organize the tasks in JavaScript — especially when it came to marking them complete or important without breaking the layout.  
Managing the dynamic parts of the page definitely pushed me to think more carefully about how the DOM updates.

Overall, I’m happy with how it turned out. I feel like I improved a lot with DOM manipulation, responsive design, and adding little touches like emojis and color changes to make the app more interactive and user-friendly.
